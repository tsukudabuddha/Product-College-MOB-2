 # URLs, URLRequests and URLSessions
 
 
 ## URL - Uniform Resource Locator
 
 ### Types of Requests
 These are the 4 main REST request types we will be looking at:-
 They each perform a specific role in http networking.
 
 - GET   :- Fetches a resource
 - POST  :- Creates a new resource
 - PUT/PATCH/UPDATE:- Updates a resource
 - DELETE:- Deletes a resource

/*:
 ## Constructing URLRequests
 
 ### Creating a get request to download an html webpage
 
 To create a network request in iOS, there are 3 main parts to it.
 
 1. First construct a url for the resource you want to get/update/delete/create
 2. Create a URLRequest with the URL
 3. Create a URLSession with the URLRequest

// 1
let url = URL(string: "www.google.com/images/434.png")!

// 2
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "GET"

// 3
let session = URLSession.shared

// 4
let downloadTask = session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
    
}

// 5
downloadTask.resume()


/*:
 ### URLRequest
 Depending on what kind of request you are making(post,get etc..), you will need to
 change the http method and add a body.
 
 ### URLSession
 The session has information about the request to be made. It is also responsible for executing the network request.
 Calling *resume()* on the task returned by the session kicks off the network request.
