 # Downloading JSON
 
 More often than not, we will be dealing with JSON responses from servers.
 Lets look at how we will grab some json from an API using a *get* request.
 
 ## JSON
 
 JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation.
 It is one of a few formats that is used to transfer information over the web.
 JSON looks like this:
 {
 "name": "Eliel"
 "age": 23
 }
 
*/

let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/1")!

var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "GET"

let session = URLSession.shared

let task = session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
    
    if let data = data {
        let json = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: .allowFragments)
        print(json)
    }
}

// Don't forget to resume task
task.resume()


/*:
 ## Sessions
 
 There are three main session types:
 1. session.uploadTask   :- Used for uploading binary files
 2. session.downloadTask :- Used for downloading binary files
 3. session.dataTask     :- Used for uploading and downloading and deleting text/html/json
 
 
 */

/*:
 ## Uploading JSON data
 
 We often need to upload data to our servers.
 Imagine creating a new user account for an app, we would need to upload information about the user necessary to create the account.
 */

/*:
 JSON in Swift is represented as a dictionary with a String key to an Any type as the value
 
 Why is that so? Lets take a look at the structure of a JSON Object.
 {
 "user": {
 "age": 23,
 "name": "peter",
 "location": [27.33, -122]
 }
 }
 
 From the above example we can see that the keys are always Strings and the values can be *Any* type of object(Int, String, Array, another JSON Object).
 
 */

//: ### Uploading JSON data
//: Lets define our JSON type as a dictionary of String to Any
typealias JSON = [String: Any]

var postReq = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://httpbin.org/post")!)

let jsonDictionary: JSON = ["user": ["first_name": "Eliel", "last_name": "Gordon"]]
let jsonData = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: jsonDictionary, options: JSONSerialization.WritingOptions.prettyPrinted)

postReq.httpMethod = "POST"
postReq.httpBody = jsonData

session.dataTask(with: postReq) { (data, resp, err) in
    if let data = data {
        let json = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: .allowFragments)
        print(json)
    }
}.resume()


/*:
 ## Challenges

 1. Can you think of a type safe way to wrap the http methods of a request?
 2. Find some JSON API resources online and use URLSession to download the JSON
